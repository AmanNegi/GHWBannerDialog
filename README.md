## GHWBannerDialog ~ [GHW 2023(FEB)](https://ghw.mlh.io)

A simple window that displays the GHW 2023 banner from the web. Build using Java using `java.awt`. This project was submitted for the Day 2 of GHW where we were supposed to build a basic Java Application. I had never built any user interface from Java(except `Android`) so I learned to do that.
